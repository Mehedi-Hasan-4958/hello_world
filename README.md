# hello_world with some added features

This is a very simple flutter project only showing two texts "Hello World Travel", a network image - directly downloaded from a website. There is also an elevated button - clicking on it shows an alert dialog box. The appbar and texts are sligtly customed. Padding and SingleChildscrollView is introduced for beatification and landscape mode.
